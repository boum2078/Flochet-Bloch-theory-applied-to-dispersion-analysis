# WFE method 
The code extracts dispersion curves from bearm with periodically located resonators using unit cell modeling only.(FLoquet Bloch is applied).
Unit cell modeling.
A very simple and explanatory implementation of wave finite element method applied to 1D propagation in Euler Bernouilli beam with or without resonators.
wave based method for 1D wave propagation applied to an Euler-Bernouilli Beam.
FLoquet Bloch theorem.
